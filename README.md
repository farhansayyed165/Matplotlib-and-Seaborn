# Matplotlib-and-Seaborn
### Learning Matplotlib and Seaborn(2 libraries of Python)

Matplotlib is considered the good old reliable library for visualizing data through Python Programming Language
On the other hand Seaborn is a library that is considered easier to work with and more colorful!

In Matplotlib, I will be learning how to plot barplots, Histograms, Pie Charts, Line graphs, Stack Plots, Scatter Plots, Sub Plots and many more!
I've yet to figure out Seaborn
